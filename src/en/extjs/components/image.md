# Nested components

The `Ext.Img` component can be used to insert an image into the Ext JS handled
lifecycle. For example the class makes it easy to change the source of the image
container.

## Exercise

* (Re-)open your `index.html` and extend the `Ext.container.Viewport` items
  by the following snippet:
[include](../snippets/component-image.js)
* Reload the page in the browser and take a look at the result:

![Nested component image in a panel.](../assets/component-image.png)
