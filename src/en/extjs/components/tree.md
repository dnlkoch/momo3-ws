# Trees

The `Ext.tree.Panel` class provides a tree-structured UI representation of
tree-structured data. A treepanel must be bound to a `Ext.data.TreeStore` (the
Ext JS data package including stores will be handled in the
[next chapter](../data/README.md)).

## Exercise

* (Re-)open your `index.html` and extend the `Ext.container.Viewport` items
  by the following snippet:
  [include](../snippets/component-treepanel.js)
* Reload the page in the browser and take a look at the result:
