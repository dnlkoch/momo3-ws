# Grid

The `Ext.grid.Panel` class is of avail for showing up (large amounts) of tabular
data. The required properties of a gridpanel are a store and a column definition.

## Exercise

* (Re-)open your `index.html` and extend the `Ext.container.Viewport` items
  by the following snippet:
[include](../snippets/component-grid.js)
* Reload the page in the browser and take a look at the result:

![Gridpanel with some inline data.](../assets/component-grid.png)

# Final output

Finally your Ext JS application should look similar to this:

![Final application layout.](../assets/component-final.png)
