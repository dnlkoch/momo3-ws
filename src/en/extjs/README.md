# ExtJS

* Introduction
* Hello ExtJS
  * include resources
  * Create a window in Ext.onReady()
  * Where to find docs...
* Layouts
  * Start with 1 Panel in a viewport (layout default: 'auto')
    * explain Viewport and 3 configs of Panel
  * Add more panels to the viewport (still auto layout)
    * show that the result is't what we really wanted
  * go to the layout browser example and pick two which you Linked
  * In the end we need to have the 'border-layout' (with panels in north, center, west, east, south)
* Components
  * start with the final example from Layouts
    * tabpanel in the center
  * Use img component in header
  * use basic form in east
  * use basic grid (local data) in south
  * use basic tree in west
* Next add behaviour
  * events, remote data / AJAX, filtering???
