# Ext JS Workshop

Welcome to the **Ext JS Workshop**. This workshop is designed to deliver you a
first insight into the JavaScript framework Ext JS for developing web
applications. As this workshop is further intended for beginners we'll mainly
focus on the core concepts and components delivered by Ext JS by simple tasks.
Hence we'll learn how to include the framework into a basic HTML page, how to
use the `Viewport`, what user interface components Ext JS provides to us and how
to programmatically interact with these components.

These goals are subdivided into the following sets of modules:

* [Introduction to Ext JS](./introduction/README.md)
* [Basics](./basics/README.md)
* [Layouts](./layouts/README.md)
* [Components](./components/README.md)
* [Data](./data/README.md)
* [Events](./events/README.md)

Let's start with the [introduction to Ext JS](./introduction/README.md)!
