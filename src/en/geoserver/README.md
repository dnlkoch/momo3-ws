# GeoServer

GeoServer is an Open Source software server written in Java that allows users
to share and edit geospatial data. Designed for interoperability, it publishes
data from any major spatial data source using open standards.

In this module we will focus on the geodata-management using the GeoServer
administration frontend. Thus we will learn how to load, publish, style, and
share geospatial data with GeoServer.

The following topics will be covered by this workshop:

* [GeoServer Basics](basics/README.md)

* [Spatial Basics]()

* [Spatial Web Services]()
