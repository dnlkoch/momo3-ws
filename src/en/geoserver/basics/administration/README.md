# Administration

This module will give you a brief introduction into the GeoServer administration
frontend where we'll focus on the mainly used configuration settings. The basis
structure of the following chapters is directly inspired by GeoServers frontend
composition (Note: The `Data` and `Tile Caching` sections will be treated in the
particular chapters [Publishing](../publishing/README.md) and
[GeoWebCache](../../advanced/gwc/README.md)).

* [Login and frontend overview](./overview.md)
* [About & Status](about/README.md)
* [Services](services/README.md)
* [Settings](settings/README.md)
* [Security](security/README.md)
