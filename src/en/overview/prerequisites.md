# Prerequisites

## Start the workshop

This workshop is intended to be executed in combination with an Linux image
delivered on an USB flash drive especially prepared for this workshop. To run
this image (and the workshop) please follow these steps:

1. Connect the provided USB flash drive to your computer and turn on the computer.
2. Normally you should see the Linux Mint boot screen similar to the image below
   after only a few seconds.

**Note:** If your computer isn't booting Linux Mint, please ensure your PC is
able and correctly configured to boot from an USB device. To do so, access your
BIOS by pressing `<DEL>` or `F2` during the early boot process (usually you will
see the correct key displayed on-screen during the boot process). Press the
required key at the correct time and your computer's BIOS will appear. Once
you're in the BIOS, try to find a menu called something like `Boot` or similar.
Navigate to this menu and look for some sort of an entry called
`Boot Option Priorities` or similar. Usually you will find the boot order as a
priority list in which you can move the USB device boot option up to the top of
this list. Now save your changes and exit the BIOS to restart your computer.

## Login to Linux

After the successful boot you should see the Linux Mint login screen as shown
in the image below:

Congratulations! Now you are ready to start the workshop! :smiley:
